What is web Services?
	A web service is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet and uses a 	standardized XML messaging system.

RESTful Web Service?
	Rest stands for Representational State Transfer
	REST is an architecture style not a protocol.

Advantages Of Rest Services
	Fast
	Language and Platform Independent
	Permits differenet data format like plain text,html,xml and JSON also

SOA(Service Oriented Architecture)

In Rest Services:
	There are different HTTP Methods that we used:(CRUD)
		GET:-For retriving the data:Read
		POST:-For creating the data:Create
		PUT:-For updating the data:Update
		DELETE:-For deleting the data:Delete

As we are using browser and browser only supports Get method so to call Rest web service to perform CRUD operation we use a client as POSTMAN instead of simple browser.

HTTP Status Code:
	1xx : Informational
	2xx : Success
	3xx : Redirection
	4xx : Clent Error
	5xx : Server Error

What is Spring Boot:
Why Spring BOOT?

When you are creating SpringBoot Application it creates a application class with main method which class annotated as @SpringBootApplication

which means
1.@Configuration
2.@EnableAutoConfiguration
3.@ComponentScan

Spring Boot starter parent POM allows us to manage the modules and multiple child project.

@RestController

1.@Controller
2.@ResponseBody
